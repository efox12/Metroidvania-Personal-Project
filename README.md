# Metroidvania-Personal-Project
This is an ongoing project to help me gain an in depth understanding of Unity engine and game development. This project is very much a work in progress, And I will continue to update and add new code on this page as I make progress. This code is here for anyone who wants to use it in their own projects. No permission is required. Note: not all scripts are complete or fully functional yet.
